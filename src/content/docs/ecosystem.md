# Ecosystem

StackBilt is three complementary tools that enforce governance across the full development lifecycle.

## The Three Pieces

| Tool | License | Role |
|------|---------|------|
| **Charter** (`@stackbilt/cli`) | Apache-2.0 (open source) | Local + CI governance runtime with ADF context compiler |
| **Stackbilder** | Commercial | Architecture generation, scaffold engine, structured artifacts |
| **Compass** | Commercial | Governance policy brain, institutional memory, ADR ledger |

Charter is the open-source foundation. Stackbilder and Compass are commercial services.

## Service Map

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| **StackBilt** | `stackbilt.dev` | Architecture generation, MCP server, scaffold engine |
| **Compass** | via Stackbilder service binding | Governance enforcement, blessed patterns, ADR ledger |
| **Auth Worker** | `auth-tenant-v2` | Authentication service (Better Auth + D1, OAuth, SSO) |
| **img-forge** | `imgforge.stackbilt.dev` | AI image generation for documentation |

## How They Fit Together

<!-- DOCSYNC:BEGIN:charter-oss-ecosystem -->
## Charter: Local Enforcement + ADF Context Compiler

Charter runs in your terminal and CI pipeline. It validates commit trailers, scores drift against your blessed stack, and blocks merges on violations. Zero SaaS dependency - all checks are deterministic and local.

Charter also ships **ADF (Attention-Directed Format)** - a modular, AST-backed context system that replaces monolithic `.cursorrules` and `claude.md` files with compiled, trigger-routed `.ai/` modules. ADF treats LLM context as a compiled language: emoji-decorated semantic keys, typed patch operations, manifest-driven progressive disclosure, and metric ceilings with CI evidence gating.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @stackbilt/cli
npx charter setup --preset fullstack --ci github --yes
npx charter adf init    # scaffold .ai/ context directory
```

**Governance commands:** `validate`, `drift`, `audit`, `classify`, `hook install`.
**ADF commands:** `adf init`, `adf fmt`, `adf patch`, `adf bundle`, `adf sync`, `adf evidence`.

For quantitative analysis of ADF's impact on autonomous system architecture, see the [Context-as-Code white paper](https://github.com/stackbilt-dev/charter-kit/blob/main/papers/context-as-code-v1.1.md).

## Stackbilder: Architecture + Scaffold

The 6-mode pipeline (PRODUCT → UX → RISK → ARCHITECT → TDD → SPRINT) produces structured artifacts with cross-referenced IDs. After completion, the scaffold engine generates a deployable Cloudflare Workers project.

Available via:
- **Browser UI** at [stackbilt.dev](https://stackbilt.dev) (interactive)
- **MCP server** at `stackbilt.dev/mcp` (agent-driven, 22 tools)
- **REST API** at `stackbilt.dev/api/flow/*` (direct HTTP)

### Lightweight Agent Pattern

The recommended agent workflow downloads ~40KB total (down from 300KB+):

```
runFullFlowAsync → getFlowSummary polls → getArtifact per mode → getFlowScaffold
```

## Compass: Policy Brain

For current Compass routes, auth endpoints, and MCP integration surfaces, see [Compass Governance API](/compass-governance-api).

Compass is an AI governance agent with institutional memory — a ledger of ADRs, blessed patterns, and constitutional rules. It validates architecture decisions, runs red-team reviews, and drafts formal policy documents.

### Governance Modes by Plan

| Plan | Max Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|----------|
| Free | `PASSIVE` | Log only — never blocks |
| Pro | `ADVISORY` | Warn on issues, flow continues |
| Enterprise | `ENFORCED` | Block on FAIL, require remediation |

When governance mode is capped by plan tier, a soft upsell prompt appears in the `governanceState` response.

### Blessed Patterns

Compass maintains a ledger of approved technology patterns. These are injected into Stackbilder's ARCHITECT prompt automatically when governance is enabled. Example:

- Compute: Cloudflare Workers (not AWS Lambda)
- Database: Cloudflare D1 (not PostgreSQL)
- Cache: Cloudflare KV (not Redis)
- Queue: Cloudflare Queues (not SQS)

### CSA Transport Modes

Communication between Stackbilder and Compass supports multiple transports:

| Transport | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `external_http` | Public HTTPS MCP endpoint (default) |
| `service_binding` | Internal Worker binding (when configured) |
| `auto` | Canary split between HTTP and binding |

Canary rollout percentage is configurable per-flow or via environment default.

## Governance-First Development

Every significant decision flows through governance before implementation:

1. **Pre-approval** — Compass validates the idea against policy
2. **Architecture** — Stackbilder generates a governed blueprint with blessed patterns
3. **Review** — Compass red-teams the architecture output
4. **Record** — ADRs are persisted to the governance ledger (when `autoPersist: true`)
5. **Scaffold** — Stackbilder generates deployable project files
6. **Commit** — Charter enforces `Governed-By:` trailer compliance at the repo level
7. **Evidence** — Charter validates ADF metric ceilings (`adf evidence --auto-measure --ci`)
8. **CI** — Charter blocks merges on drift violations or metric ceiling breaches

## Authentication Across Services

### Unified Auth (Recommended)

One access key works at both Stackbilder and Compass:

```bash
# Exchange ska_ key for a JWT
curl -X POST https://stackbilt.dev/api/auth/token \
  -H "X-Access-Key: ska_..." \
  -d '{"expires_in": 3600}'
# Use the returned JWT at either service
```

### Service-to-Service

For automated pipelines, each service has its own token:

```json
{
  "edgestack": { "url": "https://stackbilt.dev/mcp", "token": "EDGESTACK_MCP_TOKEN" },
  "compass": { "url": "https://stackbilt.dev/mcp", "transport": "service_binding", "token": "CSA_MCP_TOKEN" },
  "imgforge": { "url": "https://imgforge.stackbilt.dev/mcp", "token": "IMGFORGE_MCP_TOKEN" }
}
```
